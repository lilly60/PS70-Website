<h4>3D Models In Fusion</h4>
<p>For my 3D modeling project I decided to model a hex screwdriver and an ink bottle.<p>
<p> To create the hex screwdriver I first took the dimensions with the calipers. <p>
   <img src=hex_hand.jpg width = "250vw"> </img>
<p> I then sketched part of the screwdriver and revolved it <p>
   <img src=hexscr_sketch.png width = "100vw"> </img>
   <img src=hex_body.png  width = "200vw"> </img>
  <p> To make the hex part I sketched a hexagon and extruded it.<p>
   <img src=hex_sketch.png width = "200vw"> </img>
    <img src=hex_extrude.png width = "250vw"> </img> 
    <p> To add the contours of the handle I made offset planes and drew ovals. I then used those shapes to cut out of the body of the handle. <p>
    <img src=handle_cut.png width = "250vw"> </img>
    <img src=hex_final.png width = "250vw"> </img>
    <p> To make the ink bottle, I first used the calipers to take measurements.<p>
 <img src=ink_note.jpg width = "250vw"> </img>
  <p> Then I used those radii to create a sketch and revolve it. <p>
    <img src=ink_sketch.png width = "200vw"> </img>
    <img src=ink_revolve.png width = "200vw"> </img>
  <p> then to create the knurling I created a circular pattern of rectangles and extruded it with the cut feature.

<h4>Lasercut Box</h4>
<p>I decided to have an ambitious plan with my box. I decided I wanted to have two smaller boxes on top of a larger box that opened out to the side. <p>
<img src=box_idea.jpeg width = "250vw"> </img>

<p> I started by making the larger box. I choose the dimensions 300 mm by 300 mm by 300mm. To make the bottom I drew a construction line square. I then drew one tooth (including and the part that sticks out and the part that goes in). I then made a rectangular patern using that drawing. I used mirroring to make the teeth of all the other sides. <p>
  <img src=bottom_sketch.png width = "250vw"> </img>
<p> I used a very similar method to make the other sides of the box, expect I had to make some special changes to make all the teeth fit together. This can be seen in the corners where there are a couple teeth of special length. I extruded all the sketches the same thickness as my cardboard to make a 3D model of my box. <p>

  <img src=3D_zoom.png width = "250vw"> </img>
<p>To make the smaller box I copied my large box and scaled it down by half. I put two of these small boxes together to make a regular box that would fit on top of my big box. Because I scaled down my box the teeth ended up not deep enough, but I actually think it looks kind of cool. <p>

<p> Originally I was planing to make a hinge with two holes. I laser cut it and realized it was not going to work, so I pivoted to make a hinge with a channel in it that would allow the screw to slide with in it. <p>
  <img src=hinge.png width = "100vw"> </img>
<p> I laser cut all my pieces, assembled them with tape, and then  used hot glue to secure pieces long term. <p>
  <img src=asembly.jpeg width = "400vw"> </img>
<p>After all the boxes were assembled, I used m4 screws and my hinges to attach them together. I was super excited because my box actually worked! <p>
