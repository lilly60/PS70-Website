<h4>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h4>

<h3.5>This week's assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture.</h3.5><br>
<p>I was inspired by fake perpetual motion machine. Originally I wanted to make an archimedes screw that would turn a waterwheel. The waterwheel would then turn the archimedes screw through a series of gears. That project would be outside the scope of what I could accomplish in a week, so I decided to just make a motor powered archimedes screw.<br>
Here are some of my initial sketches:<p>

<p> I spiraled clear tubing around a pvc pipe to act as the archimedes screw. I put the pvc pipe over a metal rod axle. <p>

<p> Then I designed gears to connect my archimedes screw with different sized motors, and laser cut them <p>

<p>In my testing, the mini motor was able to power the archimedes screw, so I went ahead and cut the gears out of acrylic.<p>

<p> With the confidence from my successful test, I attached everything to a waterproof box. I connected my mini motor to a dial which could control the speed. Click <a href="file:///Users/lillianfeldman/Downloads/PS70/PS70-Website/04_microcontroller/index.html">HERE</a> to find out how I made that. <br><br>

I was successfully able to get my motor powered archimedes screw to pump water! <p>
